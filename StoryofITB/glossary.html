    <h2>THE BASIC TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS </h2>
    <p>
Having said that the technical specification of a computer matters far less than it did even a few years ago, some understanding of a little hardware technobabble will still inevitably prove useful. Most obviously such knowledge is handy when purchasing or upgrading a computer and/or related peripherals to ensure that everything will connect together and work OK. 

Decisions on hardware specification are often driven by the minimum hardware required to run specific software (such as a specific application program or operating system). Indeed, it remains most sensible for many users to decide on the software they want or need to run, and to choose or upgrade their hardware accordingly. 

In broad terms, the performance of a computer depends on four factors: the speed and architecture of its processor or "central processing unit" (CPU), how much random access memory (RAM) it has, its graphics system, and its internal hard drive speed and capacity. Also of importance to most users will be the specification of its Internet connection. Most computer users -- and in particular those working with a lot of photographs, music files or videos -- should also think about the most suitable storage devices they will need in order to keep and back-up all of thier valuable data.</p>

    <h2>PROCESSOR SPEED AND ARCHITECTURE</h2>
    <p> 
The speed of a computer's processor chip (technically known as its "clock speed") is measured in gigahertz (GHz), with the fastest modern processors currently running at up to 4.7GHz. However, for most computing tasks -- including web browsing, sending e-mails, word processing and spreadsheet work -- any processor running at 1GHz or more remains perfectly sufficient. (No really guys, it does!). 

Where higher processor speeds become more important is for applications such as video editing, 3D graphics work and (for the majority of "power users") playing computer games! For any of these applications, within reason the faster the processor the better. This said, people in need a very powerful computer have to be aware that CPU performance is now determined by far more than raw speed alone. Intel made this very clear when it introduced its system of processor numbers. These provide an indication of a processor's "architecture", "cache" and "front side bus (FSB) speed" in addition to its clock speed.</p>

    <h2>RAM</h2>
    <p>
RAM -- or "random access memory" -- is the temporary storage space that a computer loads software applications and user data into when it is running. All current RAM technologies are "volatile", which means that everything held in RAM is lost when a computer's power is removed. To a large extent, the more RAM a computer has the faster and more effectively it will operate. Computers with little RAM have to keep moving data to and from their hard disks in order to keep running. This tends to make them not just slow in general, but more annoyingly intermittently sluggish.</p>
